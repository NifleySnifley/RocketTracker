Value types:
- int
- restricted_int
- float
- restricted_float
- string (limited to fixed N chars)


Custom types allowed in the defs category:
- named restricted_int and restricted_float
- custom enums

Categorical "if" statements
- For instance, have sub parameters for each different value of a selectable enum (settings for each pyro mode!)


Generator makes:
- Makes C enums and typedefs for all defined enums
- Makes typedefs for custom named types in the definitions page


ALL ENUMS TURN INTO DEFINES!
- Enums can have "subtypes" that change them from being an enum (serialize->int) to a set of definitions that have a different type (float)
 - Maybe C enums can support this natively? 
 - Valid subtypes: int, float, string
 - Enum "!values" field can be dict
	- entries either are empty map, or one parameter for "!value"

Valid types for defs:
 - int (and range if applicable)
 - float (and range if applicable)
 - enum (with optional subtype, defaults to int for typical C-enum)


Like kconfig but mine and with floats
