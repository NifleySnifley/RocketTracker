# Seeker Frontend (GUI)

The seeker frontend is a web application that connects to the backend (seeker_backend) and provides users with a UI allowing easy configuration of the tracker, localization on a map, and visualization of flight data.

## TODO:

- [ ] Web map service mirror for mirroring certain web map services
- [ ] Configuration UI elements
- [ ] Better use for terminal
- [ ] Menu tabs for map, (3D map?), and visualization (integrated with 3D map?)
- [ ] Global state for received events (event listeners for received data?)
- [ ] Globally available websocket?
- [ ] Web FS access for saving data from FDR (make an API encpoint on the backend for fetching flight data logs as opposed to a websocket back-and-forth?)
